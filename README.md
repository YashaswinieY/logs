Use your own data with Azure OpenAI!

This code is designed to interact with the Azure OpenAI service, utilizing the Azure Cognitive Search for enhanced responses. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key components and motives:

### Purpose
The code aims to create a simple command-line interface where users can ask questions (specifically related to travel, in this case) and receive answers generated by an Azure OpenAI model.

### Breakdown of Components

1. **Imports**:
   - It imports necessary libraries: `os` for environment variable management, `json` for handling JSON data, and `dotenv` for loading environment variables from a `.env` file. It also imports `AzureOpenAI` to interact with the Azure OpenAI API.

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - The `load_dotenv()` function loads configuration settings (like API keys and endpoints) from environment variables. This is essential for securely managing sensitive information.

3. **Azure OpenAI Client Initialization**:
   - It initializes a client for Azure OpenAI using the provided endpoint, key, and deployment information. This client will be used to send requests to the OpenAI service.

4. **User Input**:
   - The user is prompted to enter a question. This input will be sent to the OpenAI model.

5. **Data Source Configuration**:
   - The code sets up an extension configuration for Azure Cognitive Search, indicating the endpoint, key, and index name to allow the OpenAI model to access search data.

6. **Sending Request**:
   - The code constructs a request to the Azure OpenAI model, including a system message defining the model's role (as a travel agent) and the user's question. The request is sent to the model, along with the search configuration.

7. **Response Handling**:
   - Once a response is received, it prints out the generated answer. If the `show_citations` flag is set to `True`, it will also parse and print citations from the response.

8. **Error Handling**:
   - Any exceptions during the execution of the main logic are caught and printed, which is useful for debugging.

### Summary
In essence, the motive of this code is to provide a user-friendly interface for querying an AI travel agent using Azure's OpenAI capabilities, while also leveraging Azure Cognitive Search for potentially more informative responses. It aims to make it easier for users to obtain travel-related information in a conversational format.
